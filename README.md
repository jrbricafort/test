# What is OmniCut?
 
 OmniCut is an app created with barbers and their clientele in mind. It is a platform created to help expedite the barber and client interaction by streamlining the appointment process. This is accomplished by having the client choose the time and place while the barber handles the rest. Compared to traditional barbershops, the barber can retain a higher percentage of their take home profit. Additionally, the client never has to go out of their way to visit a barbershop hoping that their favorite barber is in house that day.

In 2018 I graduated from the University of Delaware with a BS in Finance. During my time at UD I studied a large range of business topics including Fixed Income Securities, Information Systems, Strategic Management, Business Intelligence and Analytics, Capital Markets, Financial Investments, and International Finance.
  
These classes gave me exposure to programs like MS SQL Server, JavaScript, Capsim, Powerpoint, Excel, Word, and Access. All this time spent on the computer sparked my interest in how programs run and the design process involved when creating them. As result I used this past summer to teach myself how to code and decided this was a passion worth pursuing. Today I am currently enrolled at the Penn LPS Coding bootcamp in Philadelphia with the hopes of becoming a Fullstack Developer.
